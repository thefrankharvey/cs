Basic
- removing, inserting, or finding arbitrary values in an array can be a linear-time operation

Pros
- fast lookups
- fast push pop
- ordered-elements close in memory

Cons
- slow inserts
- slow deletes
- fixed size if static array

Tips
- Donâ€™t use an array if you need to search for unsorted items efficiently or insert and remove items frequently
- If you're asked to operate on a sorted array, you may want to consider using the 2 pointer technique
    - one pointer as a fast-runner and the other as a slow-runner
    - or you may place one pointer at the beginning and the other at the end
